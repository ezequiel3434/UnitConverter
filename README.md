# UnitConverter

Code Review: Unit Converter
You are going to build an app that allows the user to convert certain measurements from Imperial system to Metric system and vice versa. The requirements are listed below. After you have finished your app, copy and paste your code into the Discussion Forums for review. Then review someone else's code.

Note: Write all of the code in the main ViewController.swift file so copying and pasting is easier.

PART 1

Create a new single view iOS app
Create a textfield where a user can enter a number.
Next to that text field create a toggle switch that says "Miles to Kilometers" or "Kilometers to Miles" (or you can be more creative in your design)
Make a label next to the text field where the results of the conversion will be displayed.
You can do the conversion as the user types OR you can have a Calculate button to perform the operation.
The conversion must be accurate


PART 2

On the same screen create a similar set of controls for Pounds to Kilograms and vice versa
The calculations for this must also be accurate
